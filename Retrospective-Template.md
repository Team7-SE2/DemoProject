## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - No errors occured thanks to the previous experience with the Demo Project.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? 
  - Positive: we learend to bound the time we need for scrum meetings
  - Negative: we spent too much time discussing about the front end graphical style 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - we were able to work quite independently due to the fact that we well divided the tasks
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - we didn't estimated separately the Unit Tests and the E2E Tests

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - we will estimate separately the Unit Tests and the E2E Tests
  - we'll spend less time on sprint planning 
  
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We have established not only a working relationship but also an interpersonal one among us. We keep us in touch everyday even just for talk.
