## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - No errors occured thanks to the previous experience with the Demo#2 Project.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? 
  - Positive: we learned new technologies libraries such as PDF and CSV parsers
  - Negative: changing the DB's tables, after the initial setup, costs too much efforts and time

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - We well estimate the hours needed for the sprint
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - We didn't pay attention to the return code of the HTTP requests of our API. 

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - We'll focus better on the form controls of the WEB pages.
  
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - Gradually we are changing our approach to the work: we are creating a strong membership inside the group; we are not only colleagues but also friends who are knowing each others more and more.
