## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - In the story 10, we had a little estimation error about the task regarding the graphs of teacher. It happened because we were 5 people working together to fix a bug, and we went over an hour for each person.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? 
  - Positive: we improved our skills 
  - Negative: we learned that group works eats some time. 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - we were able to work in order to realize E2E tests.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - We were not able to plan correctly the time needed for task 10 

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - we'll spend less time on sprint planning 
  
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  
  - Since the last demo, everyday we want to improve our skills and in the days close to the demo, we are all very excited and we prepare well for the presentation.
